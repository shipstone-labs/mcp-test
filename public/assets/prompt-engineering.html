        <h1>Prompt Engineering Guide</h1>
        <p>Master the art of crafting effective prompts for AI models</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
        <p>
            Prompt engineering is the practice of designing, refining, and optimizing inputs to AI models to achieve desired outputs. It's become a critical skill for effectively working with large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems. Good prompt engineering can dramatically improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of AI-generated content.
        </p>

        <h2>Fundamental Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Be specific and unambiguous about what you want</li>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> Provide relevant background information</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Specify limitations and boundaries</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Demonstrate the type of output you expect</li>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Refine prompts based on results</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Different AI models have different capabilities, training data, and optimal prompting techniques. What works well for one model may not work as effectively for another.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Core Prompt Engineering Techniques</h2>
        
        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Role Prompting</h3>
            <p>
                Assign a specific role or persona to the AI to frame its responses from a particular perspective or with certain expertise.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"You are an experienced cybersecurity expert specializing in encryption. Explain how public key cryptography works to a high school student."</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Helps focus the model's knowledge domain, establishes tone, and creates a consistent perspective.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Task Decomposition</h3>
            <p>
                Break complex tasks into smaller, sequential steps that guide the model through a structured thinking process.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"I need to analyze this dataset. Please help me by:
1. Identifying the key variables
2. Suggesting appropriate statistical methods
3. Outlining potential insights we might discover
4. Recommending visualizations that would be helpful"</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Improves logical flow, reduces errors, and produces more thorough responses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Few-Shot Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Provide examples of desired input-output pairs before asking the model to perform a task.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"Rewrite these technical explanations to make them accessible to non-experts:

EXAMPLE 1:
Technical: 'The TCP protocol establishes connection through a three-way handshake process.'
Simplified: 'Computers use a three-step greeting process to make sure they're connected properly before sending data.'

EXAMPLE 2:
Technical: 'Quantum computers use qubits which can exist in superposition states.'
Simplified: 'Unlike regular computers that use bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use special bits that can be both 0 and 1 at the same time.'

Now simplify this:
Technical: 'Blockchain consensus mechanisms ensure distributed agreement without central authority.'"</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Demonstrates patterns for the model to follow, establishes formatting, and calibrates output style.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Chain of Thought Prompting</h3>
            <p>
                Explicitly instruct the model to explain its reasoning step by step before providing a final answer.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"Solve this math problem step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage:

A store is having a 25% off sale. If a jacket originally costs $80, and sales tax is 8%, what is the final price?"</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Improves accuracy for complex reasoning tasks, reveals model's thought process, and reduces logical errors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Output Formatting</h3>
            <p>
                Specify exactly how you want the response structured, including formats, sections, and data organization.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"Create a content calendar for a tech blog. Format your response as a table with the following columns:
- Week number
- Article title
- Topic category
- Target keyword
- Estimated word count

Include 8 weeks of content focused on AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing."</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures information is organized usefully, improves readability, and makes extraction of specific data easier.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
        
        <div class="technique">
            <h3>System and User Message Separation</h3>
            <p>
                For models that support separate system and user messages, use system messages to set persistent instructions and context.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"SYSTEM: You are a data visualization expert who helps users understand complex data. Always suggest the most appropriate chart types for different data relationships. Keep explanations concise and focus on best practices.

USER: I have time series data showing website traffic across multiple channels. What's the best way to visualize this?"</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Maintains consistent behavior across multiple turns, separates instructions from content, and reduces repetition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Constrained Generation</h3>
            <p>
                Set specific boundaries and limitations on what the model should or should not include in its response.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"Write a product description for our new ergonomic office chair. The description must:
- Be exactly 150-200 words
- Highlight the adjustable lumbar support and armrests
- Include at least 3 health benefits
- NOT mention price or shipping information
- Use active voice
- End with a clear call-to-action"</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures responses meet specific requirements, avoids unwanted content, and focuses model attention on key aspects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h3>Persona-Based Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                Ask the model to evaluate its own output from different perspectives to improve quality.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
"Draft an email announcing our new security policy to all employees. After drafting the email, evaluate it from the perspective of:
1. A non-technical employee
2. A security professional
3. A busy executive who will scan it quickly

Then improve the email based on these evaluations."</div>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Creates more balanced and well-considered outputs, identifies potential issues, and improves overall quality.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Vague or unclear instructions lead to unpredictable results</li>
            <li><strong>Overconstraining:</strong> Too many specific requirements can conflict and confuse the model</li>
            <li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> Extremely long prompts may dilute key instructions</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring Context Limits:</strong> Models have fixed context windows; exceeding them cuts off information</li>
            <li><strong>Leading Questions:</strong> Prompts that assume facts or guide toward specific biased conclusions</li>
            <li><strong>Failing to Iterate:</strong> Not refining prompts based on results</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a prompt library of effective prompts you've developed for different tasks. This allows you to reuse and adapt proven patterns rather than starting from scratch each time.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Measuring Prompt Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>
            When working to improve prompts, consider evaluating them based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Does the response contain factual errors?</li>
            <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Does it address the actual query or task?</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Does it cover all aspects of what was requested?</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Does it provide the information concisely?</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Do similar prompts yield similar quality results?</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Does the prompt work across different inputs within the same domain?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
